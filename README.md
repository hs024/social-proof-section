# Frontend Mentor - Social Proof Section Solution



## Overview

This is my submission for the [Frontend Mentor - Social proof section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA) challenge. The objective was to create a responsive social proof section that closely matches the provided design using HTML and CSS.

## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Mobile-first workflow

## Features

- Responsive layout for both mobile and desktop screens
- Optimized images and assets provided by Frontend Mentor
- Semantic and accessible markup
- Layout adapts to userâ€™s device for an optimal experience

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hs024/social-proof-section.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd social-proof-section
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Screenshots

_Refer to the design preview (`./design/desktop-preview.jpg`). The implementation supports both desktop and mobile layouts based on the provided designs._

## My Process

- **Planning:** Studied the JPG designs and mapped layouts, text styles, and key components.
- **Structure:** Wrote semantic HTML to organize the content meaningfully.
- **Styling:** Established base styles before addressing individual sections from top to bottom.
- **Testing:** Verified responsiveness and visual accuracy on various screen sizes.
- **Polish:** Used the style guide for alignment, colors, and typography.

## Challenges Faced

- Ensuring consistency in appearance across different device widths.

## Learnings

- Developed strategies for working from static design images.
- Strengthened CSS techniques for responsive layouts and accessibility.
- Improved workflow for managing project assets and style consistency.
